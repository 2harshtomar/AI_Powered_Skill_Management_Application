.venv is not included as it is not a good practice
please use command "python manage.py runserver" to start the project and you can test the API's on postman or web
There are two more python files consume.py and Chat.py
In Chat.py is we are using a gpt-4 model deployed on portal.azure.com
Once 2 is done Consume.py can also be executed to test if api is working.
